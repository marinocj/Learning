First, I downloaded Anaconda onto my Windows device via the following link:
        https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/

You must launch VSCode through anaconda you cannot just open vscode regularly

Then, I needed to download all of the following:
pip
pytorch
pandas
numpy
cuda
conda

To ensure pip is installed:
Open PowerShell
cd AppData/Local
pip should be in there

Now, we launch the Anaconda PowerShell Prompt (the environment we will be using).

To install cuda, follow the documentation in the following link:
        https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html

Use the following commands to install PyTorch:
conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch

To ensure installations are done:
pip show torch (PyTorch)
pip show pandas (pandas)
pip show numpy (NumPy)
nvcc -V (cuda)
conda list (conda)
