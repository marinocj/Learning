I downloaded anaconda then installed python.

After I had finished these two installation I researched what I would need in order to use
PyTorch and found that I would need to install pytorch, numpy, and pandas.

I finished the three of these installations then debugged for a few hours before I was able 
to launch vscode through anaconda and have all of the imports work.
